# Coffee-Machine
Let's have a coffee, shall we? :wink:

This elaborated program is a simplified version of a real coffee machine.
There are several commands it can carry out:

- present you its status of all available ingredients needed to make a drink, and the current revenue;
- select the ingredients you would like to update and specify the quantity to be added;
- give you all the money it has earned so far;
- and of course, make you a favorite type of coffee of your's!
  
  On today's menu there are latte, cappuccino and espresso. And that's not all! 
  You're welcome to add one the of the available syrups. Would it be hazelnut, almond or vanilla? The choice is up to you!
  
- and don't forget that you have to select 'exit' to turn it off!

Let's go and have a cup of this truly divine beverage!
